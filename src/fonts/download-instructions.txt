To complete the landing page font setup:

1. Download Satoshi font from: https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/satoshi
2. Extract the font files and copy these three files to this directory:
   - Satoshi-Regular.woff2
   - Satoshi-Medium.woff2
   - Satoshi-Bold.woff2

Alternative: The design uses system fonts as fallback, so the page will still work without the custom font.
